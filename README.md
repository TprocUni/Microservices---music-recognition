# Microservices---music-recognition
This project implements a suite of **Go-based microservices**. The services enable music storage, search, and device integration using modern RESTful APIs, handling audio files encoded in Base64. Each microservice demonstrates modular design and effective inter-service communication, reflecting real-world enterprise computing practices.
